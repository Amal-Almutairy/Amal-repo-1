## 

```{r, echo=FALSE}

chickwts %>% 
  group_by(feed) %>%
 summarise(n = n(),
               average = mean(weight),
               SD = sd(weight))

```
## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(chickwts, aes(feed, weight)) +
  geom_boxplot()

```


```{r, echo=FALSE}

ggplot(chickwts, aes(feed, weight)) +
  geom_jitter(width = 0.15) +
  stat_summary(fun.data = mean_sdl, 
               fun.args = list(mult = 1), 
               col = "red")
```

Inferential Statistics
```{r, echo=FALSE}

chickwts_lm <- lm(weight ~ feed , data =  chickwts)
chickwts_lm
anova(chickwts_lm)

```

Rate of change
```{r, echo=FALSE}
lm(formula = weight ~ feed, data = chickwts)
```


```{r eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}
```
